\problem{10}
We can represent the words in a vocabulary with binary vectors that have dimension of the number of words in the vocabulary and all values set to zero except the one value that corresponds to the index of the given word in the sorted version of this vocabulary. This is the so called one-in-K or one-hot encoding.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe a representation of a document with a vector. (Think of a representation that is based on the one-hot encoding of the words in that document and has the same dimension as a single word (size of the vocabulary).)
  \item Explain why this representation is problematic:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  Simple sentence or two 
    \item  Examples of the problem(s)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Provide atleast two more options to fix this problem.
\end{enumerate}
\problem{30}
A recurrent network in Figure~\ref{fig:RNN} takes a sequence of integers as an input and at the end of the sequence, on the last element produces a number between 0 and 1. What does a 0 mean? What does a 1 mean?  Describe which function this network is computing (what is the meaning of this function). Assume all biases are 0, and make sure the hidden state is initialized to 0 as well. Note, the inputs, the weights, and the hidden state are just scalars in this RNN.

\problem{20}
In this problem, you will implement a recurrent neural network which implements binary addition. The inputs are given as binary sequences, starting with
the least significant binary digit. (It is easier to start from the least significant bit, just like
how you did addition in grade school.) The sequences will be padded with at least one zero
on the end. For instance, the problem

\begin{equation}
  100111 + 110010 = 1011001
\end{equation}

would be represented as :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Input 1: 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0
  \item Input 2: 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0
  \item Correct output: 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1
\end{enumerate}

There are two input units corresponding to the two inputs, and one output unit. Therefore, the pattern of inputs and outputs for this example would be:

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{RNN_binary.png}
      \caption{The RNN Binary for Problem~3 }
      \label{fig:RNN}
\end{figure}

Design the weights and biases for an RNN which has two input units, three hidden units, and one output unit, which implements binary addition. All of the units use the hard threshold activation function. In particular, specify weight matrices U, V, and W, bias vector bh, and scalar bias by for the following architecture:

  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{RNN_arch.png}
      \caption{The RNN Architecture for Problem~3 }
      \label{fig:RNN}
\end{figure}

Hint: In the grade school algorithm, you add up the values in each column, including the
carry. Have one of your hidden units activate if the sum is at least 1, the second one if it is
at least 2, and the third one if it is 3.

\problem{20}
We have learned about regularization in image processing. How does regularization help in the context of Recurrent Neural Networks?

\problem{40} How is teacher forcing ratio more accurate than the model output for a sequence of inputs? How can we use teacher process to parallelize the computation?


\problem{40} Write a report on one of the following topics:
